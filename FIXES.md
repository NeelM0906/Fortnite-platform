# Fortnite Platform Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Flask Route Name Conflicts
Fixed duplicate function name errors in both API servers by renaming the health check endpoints:
- In `api.py`:
  - Changed `/api/health` endpoint function to `api_health_check()`
  - Changed `/health` endpoint function to `health_discovery_endpoint()`
- In `player_prediction_api.py`:
  - Changed `/api/health` endpoint function to `api_health_check()`
  - Changed `/health` endpoint function to `prediction_health_discovery()`

### 2. Port Conflict Resolution
- Implemented dynamic port discovery in the frontend (app.js)
- Added port conflict handling in the API servers
- The system now automatically handles "Address already in use" errors
- Web server configured to run on port 8001 instead of 8000

### 3. Frontend Error Handling
- Added more robust error handling for DOM element access
- Implemented helper functions (`safeGetElement` and `safeGetChildElement`)
- Fixed "predictions.map is not a function" error with defensive programming
- Fixed "Cannot read properties of null" errors with better null checks

### 4. Data Format Compatibility
- Enhanced data handling to support multiple API response formats
- Added support for both array and object data structures
- Implemented flexible property extraction functions
- Added legacy data format compatibility

### 5. API Communication
- Added health and status endpoints for API discovery and monitoring
- Implemented timeout handling for API requests
- Enhanced error messages for API connectivity issues

### 6. Prediction Algorithm Fixes
- Fixed array shape mismatch in confidence score calculation
- Added robust handling of empty or malformed prediction data
- Improved epsilon handling to prevent division by zero
- Added fallback confidence score when calculation fails
- Fixed confidence percentage display (properly multiplied by 100)
- Enhanced prediction explanations to support array format
- Added warning message display for prediction issues

### 7. Prediction Data Structure Handling
- Fixed nested prediction data structure handling in the frontend
- Added support for multiple property naming conventions (time/time_label, value/predicted_players/yhat)
- Implemented fallback strategies for missing lower/upper bounds
- Added informative error display when prediction data is invalid
- Enhanced logging of prediction data to aid debugging
- Fixed zero values showing in prediction UI when data was valid but not properly processed

## How to Run the Platform

1. Start the web server:
   ```
   python -m http.server 8001
   ```

2. Start the main API:
   ```
   python api.py
   ```

3. Start the prediction API:
   ```
   python player_prediction_api.py
   ```

4. Open the web app:
   ```
   http://localhost:8001/
   ```

The system will automatically handle dynamic port assignment and discovery.
